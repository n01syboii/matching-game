### Building for Production

To build the game for production:

```
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `build` directory.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Match all pairs of identical emojis before the timer reaches zero.
2. **How to Play**:

   - Click on a card to flip it and reveal the emoji.
   - Click on another card to find its matching pair.
   - If the two cards match, they remain face up.
   - If they donâ€™t match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
   - The game ends when all pairs are matched or the timer runs out.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The game tracks the time remaining, encouraging you to improve your speed.
   - The faster you match all pairs, the better your performance.

## Customization

You can easily customize the game to suit your preferences:

- **Change the Emoji Set**: Modify the `emoji` array in the `emojis.ts` file to use different emojis.
- **Adjust the Grid Size**: The `size` variable controls the number of cards on the grid. Adjust it to change the difficulty.
- **Modify Timer Duration**: The initial timer duration is set to 60 seconds. You can change the `time` variable to adjust this.

## Development

If you wish to contribute to the development of this game or customize it further, here's a brief overview of the code structure:

- **Main Components**: The core logic is in the `<script lang="ts">` block of the main component.
- **State Management**: The game state (`start`, `playing`, `won`, `lost`, `paused`) is managed using a TypeScript `State` type.
- **Game Logic**: Functions like `createGrid`, `selectCard`, `matchCards`, `startGameTimer`, `resetGame`, `gameWon`, and `gameLost` control the game's flow and functionality.
